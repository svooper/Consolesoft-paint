# Consolesoft Paint
A painting program meade in C++

I am not very experianced in C++ programming but have some experiance with unity C# and python.
Sorry fro the spaghetti code and feel free to improve my code.

I made this small project for fun before learning a graphics library.

Controls: W/S/A/D for moving the cursor, space to paint at the cursors position
C to clear the canvas, E to erase at the cursors position

In the menu use up/down keys to chhose between start/exit and press enter to either exit or start.

IMPORTANT please enter fullscreen mode before starting or else some graphical issues may occur
